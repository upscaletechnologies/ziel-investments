                p.mt-3.text-muted.mb-0 Based on the analysis, a PoC is developed to determine the financial model, estimated ROI, bot design process, along with the documentation and data required to create the automated flow. At this stage, the company or project head ultimately decides whether or not to authorize this case for deployment.

                p.mt-3.text-muted.mb-0 This is where the real application of design and development comes together. After identifying the procedure of implementation, the risks as well as costs involved, the bot is created to automate time-consuming, repetitive processes after a series of reruns and rigorous testing.
